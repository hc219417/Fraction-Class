# Fraction-Class
**This project is intended to accomplish the following:**
- Learn to develop a basic data class (fraction number)
- Develop habit of testing each method in the class as soon as it is written
- Follow the *"Start small. Do one thing at a time. Test it. Continue."* paradigm

**Other tasks for this project include...**
1. **Create a special exception class** (throwing exception)
2. **Methods**
   - GCD (greatest common divisor)
   - toString & toDouble
   - Math, test, and exam methods
3. **Add data fields** (class invariants)
4. **Add constructors**
   - full service c-tor
   - one argument c-tor
   - zero arg/default c-tor
5. **Testing** (as soon as you add any method to the class, you want to **TEST IT!!!!!**)
